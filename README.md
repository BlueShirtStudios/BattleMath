BattleMath
It puts a twist on the normal battleship game. The main focus of the game is for younger audiences to enjoy math and understand it. Using mental maths in a certain amount of time to determine is the top equation bigger, smaller or equal to the bottom equation, Only then you gain a turn to shoot the enemy ship like normal battleships. 
Your fleet can become in danger too, calculate a wrong answer and boom one of your ships sank. If you can sink the enemy fleet without losing your fleet you won the game. 

This was coded with elemtary delphi elements and algorithms as a side project. Later updates could be seen in the future. Maybe a way to add more grids and generate at random grids and improve the overall UI of the game. 

The maths your required to do is straight forward mental maths. Making use of addition and multipication to train your brain in a fun way.
